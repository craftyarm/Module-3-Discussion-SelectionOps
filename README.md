# RockPaperScissors

A simple Java-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game that allows for both single-round play and an optional “best-of-three” rematch if the computer loses. 

## Features

- **Single Round Play**: Enter your move (rock, paper, or scissors), and see if you beat the computer’s random choice.  
- **Best-of-Three**: If the player wins a single round, the user is offered the option to try for two out of three.  
- **Input Validation**: Checks for valid moves and handles invalid input with a prompt to re-enter.  
- **Replay**: After each round, the user can decide whether to play again or quit.

## How to Play

1. **Launch** the game from the terminal or command prompt.  
2. **Type** your move: `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.  
3. **View** the computer’s move and see who wins.  
4. If you **win**, you’ll be asked if you want a “two out of three” rematch.  
5. **Keep playing** single rounds until you choose to quit!
